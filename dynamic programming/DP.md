## Dynamic Programming Steps

1. **Identify the optimal substructure:** Break down the problem into smaller subproblems that can be solved independently.

2. **Define the recursive relationship:** Express the solution to the problem in terms of solutions to its subproblems.

3. **Create a memoization table:** Use a data structure to store the solutions to subproblems that have already been solved.

4. **Solve the subproblems:** Use the recursive relationship to solve the subproblems in a bottom-up or top-down manner.

5. **Build the final solution:** Combine the solutions to the subproblems to obtain the solution to the original problem.

6. **Analyze the time and space complexity:** Evaluate the efficiency of the dynamic programming solution.

7. **Implement the solution:** Write the code that implements the dynamic programming solution.

8. **Test and validate the solution:** Verify that the dynamic programming solution produces correct results for different inputs.

9. **Optimize if necessary:** Look for opportunities to optimize the dynamic programming solution by reducing redundant computations or using alternative data structures.

10. **Document the solution:** Provide clear explanations and documentation for the dynamic programming solution.
