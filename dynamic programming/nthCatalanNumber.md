Catalan numbers are defined as a mathematical sequence that
consists of positive integers, which can be used to find the
number of possibilities of various combinations.

The nth term in the sequence Cn is found using the following formula:

Cn = (2n)! / ((n+1)! * n!)

To solve this problem using dynamic programming, we can follow these steps:
